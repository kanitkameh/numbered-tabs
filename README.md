# Numbered tabs

A simple chrome extension that adds a number before the tab title.  
Helpful for those who use the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜ + <num>` to switch between tabs.
Has no limit on the number of tabs which have a number in front of them.

## Limitations

It doesn't work for any URLs starting with `chrome://`. Google doesn't give developers permission to modify such pages.
Examples of pages with the `chrome://` URL include the following:
- New tab page
- Extensions page
- Settings page

## Acknolwedgements

This extension is a fork based on the extension [numbered-tabs](https://github.com/narinluangrath/numbered-tabs).  
I build this to remove the limit it had to number up to only 9 tabs.
